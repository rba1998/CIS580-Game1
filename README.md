~~Attack of the Pugs~~

Disclaimer: No pugs were harmed in the making of this game. All lasers fired from the player ship
            are only teleporting the hit pugs to a safe, faraway location with plenty of treats for them.
            
Each hit pug awards 1 point. The game is over when a pug touches the player ship, and can be replayed by
rerunning the program.
